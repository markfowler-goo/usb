`usb` is a pure Go implementation of the USB stack (no CGo). It is a `libusb` alternative for situations you need a go-native library.

`usb` currently only supports linux, but with enough interest or requests, we can add more platforms.



Getting Started
-----------------

```go
package main

import  "github.com/pzl/usb"

func main() {
    dev, err := usb.VidPid(0x0c45, 0x6300) // get device by IDs
    if err != nil {
        // handle...
    }
}

```


Usage
-------

The top-level of this project can be used as a high-level library. See the docs at [godoc][godoc].

The `gusb` sub-directory can be used as a more low-level library, if that suits your needs. Documentation also at [godoc][godoc].


Status
-------

Conversion from libusb is underway. Almost all enumeration and device descriptor function is implemented. IO (both sync and async) is in progress.

See [API](API.md) for a direct mapping of libusb calls to `usb` methods.


Release History
----------------
- 0.0.1
    + Work in Progress
- 0.0.2
    + Added functionality for BulkIn and BulkOut transfers.
